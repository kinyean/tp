### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`ApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`, `NotesWindow`, and `SummaryWindow`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the
commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Application` objects residing in the `Model`.
* responds to `UiAction` values returned in `CommandResult` to open secondary windows such as Help, Notes, and Summary.

`MainWindow` also binds keyboard accelerators for menu actions, e.g. `F1` for Help and `F2` for Summary.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an application).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores HireME data i.e., all `Application` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicationList` object).
* stores the currently displayed applications as a filtered list exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Application>` so that the UI updates automatically when the filtered list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the currently selected application for notes viewing/editing in `selectedNotesApplication`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

An `Application` currently contains:

* identity fields: `companyName` and `role`
* required tracking fields: `date` and `status`
* optional reference fields: `email`, `website`, and `address`
* additional state fields: `notes`, `isArchived`, and `tags`

`Model` also defines commonly used predicates:

* `PREDICATE_SHOW_UNARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS`
* `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS`
* `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_APPLICATIONS`

`ModelManager` keeps track of the current predicate so that commands such as `edit` and `unarchive`
can refresh the list without unexpectedly changing the user’s current view.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes noteworthy implementation details of features that are currently present in HireME.

### Find feature

The `find` feature filters the displayed application list based on one or more user-provided search fields.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions when the user executes `find n/google`:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/google` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

`find` is implemented using `FindCommandParser`, `ApplicationMatchesPredicate`, and `FindCommand`:

* `AddressBookParser` delegates `find` input to `FindCommandParser`.
* `FindCommandParser` parses the supplied prefixed fields and constructs an `ApplicationMatchesPredicate`.
* `FindCommand` applies that matching condition through `Model#updateFilteredApplicationList(...)`.


### Archive state and filtered list views

Archive state is stored directly in `Application` as the boolean field `isArchived`.

![Archive/filter sequence](images/ArchiveFilterSequenceDiagram.png)


This affects multiple layers:

* `Application` stores the archive flag as part of the model state.
* `JsonAdaptedApplication` serializes `isArchived` to JSON and defaults missing values to `false` when reading older data files.
* `Model` exposes `PREDICATE_SHOW_UNARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS` and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS`.
* `ModelManager` starts with the unarchived predicate by default, so archived applications are hidden from the normal view.

`list` and `list archived` are implemented by `ListCommand` and `ListCommandParser`:

* `list` applies `PREDICATE_SHOW_UNARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS`
* `list archived` applies `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_APPLICATIONS`

`archive INDEX` and `unarchive INDEX` replace the target `Application` with a new immutable `Application`
instance whose `isArchived` value is toggled. This keeps the implementation consistent with the rest of the model,
where edits are represented by replacing immutable objects rather than mutating them in place.

One important design detail is that `ModelManager` stores the current filter predicate. This allows commands such as
`edit`, `archive`, and `unarchive` to refresh the displayed list without accidentally resetting the current view.

### Notes window flow

HireME stores free-form notes directly in each `Application` using the `notes` field.

The notes feature is implemented using three cooperating pieces:

* `OpenCommand` selects an application from the currently displayed list and indicates whether notes should be shown
  in view mode or edit mode.
* `ModelManager` stores the selected application in `selectedNotesApplication`.
* `MainWindow` reacts to the `UiAction` in `CommandResult` and opens `NotesWindow` in the appropriate mode.

When the user saves notes from the notes window:

1. `NotesWindow` calls back into `Logic`.
2. `Logic` delegates to `Model#saveApplicationNotes`.
3. `ModelManager#saveApplicationNotes` creates a replacement `Application` with updated notes.
4. The replacement preserves the existing `isArchived` flag and other fields.

This design keeps the note editor out of the command parser while still preserving a single source of truth for
application data in the model.

### Summary window flow

The summary feature is implemented by `SummaryCommand`.

When `summary` is executed:

1. `SummaryCommand` retrieves all stored applications from the model.
2. It computes counts for active applications only (`Pending`, `Offered`, `Rejected`) and separately counts archived
   applications.
3. It returns a `CommandResult` with `UiAction.SHOW_SUMMARY`.
4. `MainWindow` opens or focuses `SummaryWindow` and passes the generated summary text to it.

`MainWindow` also listens for changes in the filtered application list and refreshes the summary window while it is
open. This keeps the summary display aligned with the latest in-memory data after commands modify HireME data.

### UI action dispatch

HireME uses `CommandResult` plus `UiAction` to decouple command execution from JavaFX window management.

Commands remain responsible for domain logic only:

* `HelpCommand` returns `UiAction.SHOW_HELP`
* `SummaryCommand` returns `UiAction.SHOW_SUMMARY`
* `OpenCommand` returns either `UiAction.SHOW_NOTE` or `UiAction.EDIT_NOTE`
* `ExitCommand` returns `UiAction.EXIT`

`MainWindow` interprets these actions and performs the actual UI work. This keeps command classes testable and avoids
coupling them directly to JavaFX classes such as `Stage`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

Undo/redo is not implemented in the current codebase yet, but it remains a possible future enhancement.
The following design is therefore a proposal rather than a description of existing behavior.

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` - Saves the current HireME state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` - Restores the previous HireME state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` - Restores a previously undone HireME state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`,
`Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism would behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `VersionedAddressBook` is initialized with the initial
HireME state, and the `currentStatePointer` points to that single state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` to delete the 5th application in HireME. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state after the command executes to be saved in
`addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new application. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified state to be saved into `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, it will not call <code>Model#commitAddressBook()</code>, so the HireME state will not be saved into <code>addressBookStateList</code>.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the application was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command calls `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which shifts the
`currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous state, and restores HireME to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong> If the <code>currentStatePointer</code> is at index 0, pointing to the initial state, then there are no previous states to restore. The <code>undo</code> command uses <code>Model#canUndoAddressBook()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it returns an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation would go through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for <code>UndoCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation would go through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite - it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the
`currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores HireME to that state.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong> If the <code>currentStatePointer</code> is at index <code>addressBookStateList.size() - 1</code>, pointing to the latest state, then there are no undone states to restore. The <code>redo</code> command uses <code>Model#canRedoAddressBook()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it returns an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify stored data, such as `list`,
would usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus,
`addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of `addressBookStateList`, all states after `currentStatePointer` are purged. This matches the
behavior of many desktop applications where making a new change invalidates the redo chain.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what would happen when a user executes a new mutating command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire state as snapshots.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and reason about.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Each command knows how to undo/redo itself.
  * Pros: Uses less memory in some cases, e.g. `delete` can store only the deleted application.
  * Cons: Every mutating command needs explicit undo/redo logic, which increases implementation complexity.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Relative to AB3, this project required moderate effort overall. The team reused the AB3 architecture, command
framework, storage layer structure, and much of the testing setup, which significantly reduced the baseline effort
needed to produce a working JavaFX application. However, substantial work was still required to reshape the product
from a generic contact manager into an internship-application tracker with domain-specific behavior.

The main implementation challenge was not the number of entity types, since HireME still centers around a primary
`Application` entity, but the amount of product-specific behavior added around that entity. Compared with AB3, the
project had to support application-specific fields such as `role`, `date`, `status`, `notes`, and archive state;
field-based filtering through `find`; secondary windows for help, notes, and summary; archived and unarchived list
views; and summary statistics that distinguish active applications from archived ones. These features required
coordinated changes across the model, parser, command, UI, storage, and test layers.

The most difficult parts were maintaining consistency across layers and removing inherited AB3 assumptions. A feature
such as archiving is not just a command change: it also affects model predicates, JSON serialization, UI rendering,
command semantics, and user/developer documentation. Similarly, the notes and summary features required explicit UI
action dispatch from commands through `CommandResult` into `MainWindow`, instead of staying within a simple
single-window list application.

Reuse from AB3 almost certainly accounts for well above 5% of the total project effort. In particular, the project
reused the overall component architecture, JavaFX application shell, parser-command structure, filtered-list model
pattern, JSON storage approach, and large parts of the test harness. That reuse reduced effort on infrastructure and
allowed more time to be spent on adapting the product to the internship-tracking domain. The effort in this project
therefore went primarily into adaptation and extension rather than building a desktop application framework from
scratch.

In terms of achievements, the project successfully transformed AB3 into a domain-specific product with a clearer user
workflow for internship tracking. The codebase now supports active versus archived application views, structured
application metadata, notes management, summary reporting, and HireME-specific documentation. The work is therefore
best understood as a meaningful product adaptation on top of AB3, rather than a cosmetic rename of the original code
base.
